# JavaScript Increment & Decrement Operators Explained 

Understanding **increment (`++`)** and **decrement (`--`)** operators in JavaScript is essential for handling variable manipulations efficiently. These operators are used to increase or decrease a variable's value by **1**.

## üîπ Types of Increment & Decrement Operators  

1. **Pre-Increment (`++x`)**: Increases the value **before** using it in an expression.  
2. **Post-Increment (`x++`)**: Uses the current value first, then increases it.  
3. **Pre-Decrement (`--x`)**: Decreases the value **before** using it.  
4. **Post-Decrement (`x--`)**: Uses the current value first, then decreases it.

### üìå Examples  

```js
let a = 5;
console.log(++a); // Output: 6 (Pre-Increment: Increment first, then use)
console.log(a++); // Output: 6 (Post-Increment: Use first, then increment)
console.log(a);   // Output: 7 (After Post-Increment, value is updated)
```

## Code Challenges & Explanations
Below are various tricky cases involving increment & decrement operators.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Example:
```
let i = 11;
i = i++ + ++i;
console.log(i); 
```
```
Output: 24
```

### Explanation:

1. **i++ (post-increment)** uses 11 and then increases i to 12.

2. **++i (pre-increment)** increases i to 13 and uses it.

3. So , 11 + 13 = 24 <- Output
